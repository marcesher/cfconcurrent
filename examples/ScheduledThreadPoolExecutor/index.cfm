	  	<h1>Scheduled Executor</h1>
	   	<p>
			A Scheduled Executor (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html" target="_blank">javadoc</a>)
			asynchronously runs tasks that you submit to it, on a schedule.

			Calls to the various schedule() methods will return a ScheduledFuture (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledFuture.html" target="_blank">javadoc</a>), and you can use the future to track the status of your task's execution. You also use the ScheduledFuture to cancel the task.
		</p>

		<p>
			You use a Scheduled Executor when you want to submit a Task to be run periodically. A common idiom is to use a Scheduled Executor to periodically check for work to be done
			in some type of workflow system. When work is found, the scheduled task can then use its own <a href="../ExecutorService">Executor Service</a>
			or <a href="../CompletionService">Completion Service</a> to asynchronously execute the work it finds.
		</p>

		<p>
			Executor and Completion Services are for one-time tasks. Scheduled Executors are used for a small number of tasks expected to be run repeatedly on a schedule.
