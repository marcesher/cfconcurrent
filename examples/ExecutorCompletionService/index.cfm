	  	<h1>Executor Completion Service</h1>
	   <p>
			An Executor Completion Service (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorCompletionService.html" target="_blank">javadoc</a>)
			asynchronously runs tasks that you submit to it. It puts the completed results into a Completion Queue, which you occassionally poll.
		</p>

		<p>
			Polling the completion queue returns a Future (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html">javadoc</a>) for each completed Task,
			and you can call get() on that future to fetch the result.
		</p>

		<p>
			CFConcurrent makes this all even easier. You needn't write the polling code... you simply write a "processor" CFC that exposes a "process( array_of_results )" method,
			and whenever the completion queue is polled, it'll send the results to your process() implementation.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you need to submit your task and need to wait for its result -- and you do not need your tasks to be put into a completion queue for later processing,
			 then you should use the simpler <a href="../ExecutorService">Executor Service</a>
